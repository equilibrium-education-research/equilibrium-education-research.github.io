Economics topics are diverse but the fundamental framework is pretty simple. Once we understand the concept of market, we can analyze all the consequence relatively easily.

1. Market theory, also known as, supply and demand model is key to have better understanding of Economics.

3. Supply and demand meet at the market and then we can observe the equilibrium eventually.
